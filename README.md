# dwmdots
Repository containing the heart-attack inducing dotfiles of/to my poorly designed dwm setup. (Suckless rules, btw!!!)
The st build included in the repository does not belong to me. Apart from a few minor changes, nothing has been done in any way that would enable me 
to claim ownership of this build. It belongs to Lukesmith. As for the rest, the case is quite different. The picom build is a minor modification of another build.
The rest are all the products of my efforts and foolishness. 

I reckon there is no need to elucidate what is to be done with these files. Those who have come here must be well aware of how to set these files up. 

Void users have to download the following packages in order to use the build as intended.

> base-devel
> xorg/xorg-minimal(duh!)
> elogind
> dbus-elogind
> dbus-elogind-libs
> dbus-elogind-x11
> polkit
> NotoColorEmoji (font)
> libXft-bgra
> libXinerama
> libXinerama-devel
> libXft
> libXft-devel
> harfbuzz
> harfbuzz-devel 
> libX11-devel
> xwallpaper
> sxhkd (optional) (the included sxhkdrc file is designed specifically to fit my needs)
> picom 
> ShureTechMono (font)
> JetBrainsMono (optional)
> xsecurelock
